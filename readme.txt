== Description ==
Index spy attempts to connect to a Wordpress Installation's XML Sitemap, which is generated by a third party plugin called <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/' target=_blank>XML Sitemap Generator Plugin</a>. Once connected, Index Spy will run a special query on each link found in the sitemap and report back weather that link is indexed in google or not indexed.

Further, a user can select/deselect items in the report to create an rss feed out of those selected items for rss submissions and other kinds of rss promotion.
